One of the most common denial-of-service attacks on the Internet today is the TCP SYN flood. In this
project part, we will look at different options of mitigating this attack type. Specifically, you will implement and
compare mitigation strategies working at the transport and the application layers, and evaluate the success and
performance if the mitigation measure has context knowledge about the application layer protocol.
After you can successfully defend against the SYN flood, we will turn our attention to legacy devices, in other
words hosts and systems that can neither be upgraded to adhere to current protection standards nor be replaced
by an alternative. Within the context of a SYN flood, we will practice how an IPS can man-in-the-middle
connection attempts to filter out requests that otherwise could harm the vulnerable device.
